                <h2>Brief History</h2>
                <p>
                    A former toy inventer, Vincent Patilio set out to make 
                    some money by embarking on a criminal 
                    career after he created a 
                    pair of electrically-powered 
                    jumping coils and wore a big green frog suit.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He was soon met by numerous humiliating defeats, 
                    first by Daredevil, and later by Iron Man and Spider-Man. 
                    In fact, his bad luck proved quite early in his career: 
                    after his first defeat by Daredevil, while on trial, 
                    Vincent tricked the court into giving him his shoes 
                    and jumped out of the window which was three stories high. 
                    However, he didn't know that the fasteners were removed and 
                    broke a leg as a result, just as Stilt-Man was coming to 
                    break him free. Patiilio's leg later healed, only for him 
                    to meet defeat alongside Electro's Emissaries Of Evil. 
                    When he was later released from prison, 
                    his wife, Rose, succumbed to cancer. 
                    It had been her paycheck that supported the 
                    house hold, which included their son, Eugene.

                    Eugene sought to clear his father's name by donning his 
                    Leap-Frog suit, and calling himself, Frog Man. As Frog Man, 
                    he helped Spider-Man and the Human Torch defeat 
                    the Speed Demon. Vinnie didn't want his son risking 
                    his life for money, so he decided to stop this by 
                    going undercover for the police to get a confession 
                    from the White Rabbit. He offered her his services 
                    and got a recorded confession from the White Rabbit 
                    about stolen loot. After White Rabbit was defeated 
                    by Frog Man and Spider-Man, 
                    Vinnie and his son have been living off the reward 
                    money from the recorded confession ever since.

                <p>
                    Leap-Frog's suit gave Vincent enhanced strength and agility, 
                    allowing him to jump several stories high. 
                    Other than that, he was a skilled inventor.

            <p>
                The crew of a commercial spacecraft called 
                the "<i>Nostromo</i>" encounters a deadly lifeform 
                after investigating a mysterious transmission of unknown origin.
                This deadly lifeform then terrorizes the crew of the 
                spacecraft as it picks them apart one by one until there
                is only one sole survivor remaining. That sole survivor,
                Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), must fend off and survive
                the creature all alone and try to get it off the ship.

                    The <b>Cluemaster (Arthur Brown)</b> 
                    is a supervillain appearing 
                    in American comic books published by DC Comics, 
                    commonly as an adversary of the superhero Batman 
                    as well as a recurring enemy 
                    of Tim Drake, the third Robin.<sup>[1]</sup> 
                    Cluemaster first appeared in 
                    Detective Comics #351 (May 1966) 
                    and was created by Gardner Fox and Carmine Infantino.

                <p>
                    A failed game show host, the character became a criminal 
                    who leaves clues to his crimes, 
                    but unlike the Riddler's clues, 
                    they are not in the form of riddles. 
                    He is also the father of Stephanie Brown who became 
                    the vigilante Spoiler and later the 
                    fourth Robin and third Batgirl.<sup>[2]</sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cluemaster appeared in the second season 
                    of the Arrowverse series Batwoman, 
                    portrayed by Rick Miller. 
                    Ethan Embry portrayed Arthur Brown in Gotham Knights.

                    The Cluemaster starts his criminal campaign by a daring 
                    but unsuccessful attempt to learn Batman's identity 
                    and gain a fighting edge.
                    <sup>[2]</sup><sup>[4]</sup> He returns 
                    to Gotham for a rematch with Batman,<sup>[5]</sup> 
                    then appears in several supervillain 
                    crowd scenes over the years.<sup>[6]</sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                    With several other villains, Cluemaster becomes a 
                    member of the Injustice League, 
                    a team of out-of-luck supervillains who, 
                    when banding together, become even less successful 
                    than they have been in 
                    their individual careers.<sup>[7]</sup> 
                    The Injustice League have been defeated time and again by 
                    the Justice League International, at least when they are 
                    not making laughingstocks of themselves. 
                    Trying to reform, the members later become the core of the 
                    equally laughable hero team 
                    Justice League Antarctica.<sup>[8]</sup> They help out the 
                    Justice League when JLI liaison 
                    Maxwell Lord lies in a coma,<sup>[9]</sup> 
                    but again later reform as the 
                    Injustice League as henchmen of Sonar.<sup>[10]</sup>

                    Cluemaster reappears in Detective Comics #647 
                    by Chuck Dixon and Tom Lyle. In this three-issue story, 
                    Cluemaster has reformed and been released 
                    from Blackgate Penitentiary. Cured of his compulsion to 
                    leave clues, Cluemaster originally joins a 
                    gang and plans their heists in exchange for 10 percent 
                    of their winnings. He later kills the 
                    leader by suffocating him with 
                    a strong polymer over his mouth and nose, 
                    and begins to plan a master heist.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During this time, it is revealed Arthur Brown 
                    has a daughter named Stephanie through a 
                    woman named Crystal Brown, but rarely spends any time 
                    with her due to long periods of incarceration. 
                    Stephanie is furious when she discovers that he has 
                    returned to crime without his need to leave clues behind. 
                    Making a costume for herself, she calls herself 
                    The Spoiler, finds out her father's plans, 
                    and leaves clues so that the police and 
                    Batman can stop him.<sup>[11]</sup> Robin spots Spoiler 
                    on the rooftops during a police bust of 
                    Cluemaster's apartment and unmasks her, 
                    though she incapacitates Robin by hitting him 
                    in the face with a brick. Robin tracks her down 
                    and Batman, Robin and Spoiler set a plan in motion to 
                    take down Cluemaster. Spoiler was forbidden 
                    from going to the bust because she was only 
                    motivated by revenge. Catching Cluemaster at his 
                    mall heist whilst he hauls a giant glass canister 
                    of money away by air, Stephanie is then held hostage 
                    by Cluemaster atop the canister, holding a vial of acid 
                    to her face as Batman tries to stop him. Batman tells 
                    Cluemaster to stop and Cluemaster, thinking Batman will 
                    only lecture him about how it is morally 
                    wrong to disfigure a child, is taken aback when 
                    Batman simply reveals Spoiler is his daughter. 
                    Spoiler uses the shock of the revelation to gain 
                    the upper hand and uses one of the chains attached 
                    to the Gunship lifting the 
                    canister to strangle Cluemaster, 
                    but Batman prevents this. 
                    Cluemaster is taken back to Blackgate.<sup>[2]</sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Each time the Cluemaster escapes or start some new plan, 
                    Stephanie dons her costume again to foil him. 
                    Eventually, she realizes she enjoys being a hero, 
                    and begins regular patrols as Spoiler. 
                    For a brief period of time she even 
                    replaces her boyfriend, Tim Drake, as Robin.

                <p>
                    Cluemaster and his teammates in the Injustice League 
                    volunteer to join the second Suicide Squad, 
                    a group sanctioned by the US government, 
                    in return for a full pardon of his crimes. 
                    The Cluemaster also hopes to make 
                    Stephanie proud of him.<sup>[2]</sup> During the mission, 
                    which involves dealing with terrorists and a 
                    lovesick genetic experiment, Cluemaster sees his friends, 
                    Big Sir, Clock King and Multi-Man die 
                    (though Multi-Man has the power to be reborn again). 
                    In the resulting chaotic battle, Cluemaster seemingly 
                    saves Major Disaster's life twice, 
                    though the Major admits the situation was confusing.
                     Cluemaster is seen shot many times through the chest. 
                     He survives this incident, with 
                     a year's recuperation in the hospital and many, 
                    many scars. He is encouraged 
                    by thoughts of his daughter.<sup>[12]</sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                    When he gets out and discovers that his daughter 
                    has been killed, he takes on the secret identity 
                    Aaron Black and creates the "Campaign for Culpability", 
                    blaming Batman for his involvement in Stephanie's death,
                     saying that she was not the first child working 
                    with Batman to die, and that 
                    Batman should be brought to justice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is later revealed that Stephanie survived the incident 
                    that everyone believed had killed her, 
                    and spent some time recuperating overseas.<sup>[13]</sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Robin (vol. 2) #177 was planned by Chuck Dixon intended 
                    to feature Cluemaster, but Dixon's 
                    abrupt exodus from DC meant the issue was scrapped.

                    Cluemaster finally reappears after Stephanie Brown 
                    has become the new Batgirl. He is revealed to be 
                    the man who has been funding the Reapers, 
                    a group of young supervillains 
                    who have been battling Batgirl.<sup>[14]</sup>

                <h3 id="new">The New 52</h3>
                <p>
                    In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. 
                    In this new timeline, as part 
                    of the Forever Evil storyline, 
                    Cluemaster is among the villains 
                    that the Crime Syndicate of America 
                    recruited to join the
                     Secret Society of Super Villains.<sup>[15]</sup>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Cluemaster appears as a villain in the 
                    Batman: Eternal series, plotting with several other 
                    minor villains when interrupted by his daughter, 
                    Stephanie Brown, who overhears part of the plotting by 
                    her father and his associates. This is Cluemaster's 
                    first full appearance in 
                    the New 52 continuity.<sup>[16]</sup> 
                    He is later revealed to be the final mastermind behind 
                    the systematic attack on Batman by various villains; 
                    inspired by an old theory he had when talking with other 
                    lower-grade villains that they could take action while 
                    Batman was occupied with the bigger criminals, he sent 
                    out invitations to other big-league foes to take 
                    action after the fall of Commissioner Gordon, 
                    and then all he had to do was slip a 
                    basic mind-control drug into Gordon's coffee to make 
                    him see a threat that wasn't there and let the 
                    other villains do what they wanted, guessing correctly 
                    that Batman would never think to look at a small-timer 
                    when so many bigger villains were playing a 
                    part in the scheme. Although Brown manages to capture 
                    and unmask Batman, Bruce is able to escape his bonds and 
                    fight back, but he has taken such a beating over the 
                    course of the storyline that Cluemaster manages to 
                    overpower him, only for Lincoln March to show up behind 
                    Cluemaster and slit his throat,<sup>[17]</sup> 
                    revealing that he funded 
                    Cluemaster's plans solely so that he 
                    could kill Batman at this point in secret.<sup>[18]</sup>

                <p>
                    In 2016, DC Comics implemented another relaunch of its 
                    books called "DC Rebirth" which restored its 
                    continuity to a form much as it was prior to "The New 52".
                     During "The War of Jokes and Riddles", 
                     Cluemaster is seen as a 
                     member of Joker's team.<sup>[19]</sup> 
                     After Batman joins the war on the side of the Riddler 
                     and begins taking out Joker’s allies one by one, 
                     Cluemaster suggests to Kite Man that they let 
                     themselves be beaten rather than flee and face 
                     the wrath of both kingpins. However, he is then 
                     gassed by the Scarecrow, 
                    one of Riddler’s allies, 
                    and taken out of the conflict.

                    In a three-issue story arc beginning 
                    in Batgirls #13 (February 2023) Cluemaster kidnaps 
                    Stephanie but is thwarted by Cassandra Cain.

                    Unlike most of Batman's villains, Cluemaster is 
                    completely sane, which gives him a unique relationship 
                    with Batman. Cluemaster has no metahuman 
                    powers or abilities. He has a number 
                    of plasti-glass pellets attached 
                    to the front of his uniform. The pellets contain various 
                    offensive weaponry including: 
                    blinding incendiary flares, smoke, 
                    incapacitating gas, and explosives.

                    Arthur Brown / Cluemaster appears in The Batman, 
                    voiced by Glenn Shadix as an adult and by 
                    Kath Soucie as a child. This version was a spoiled, 
                    self-entitled, yet brilliant prodigy with an 
                    inferiority complex and Peter Pan syndrome. 
                    After losing on the game show Think Thank Thunk 
                    following a twelve-week champion run and failed attempt 
                    by his mother to sue everyone involved on the grounds 
                    that the show was rigged, Brown dropped out of school
